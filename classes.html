                Our nutritionists host bi-weekly presentations and take
                questions about healthy eating without breaking the bank...
              </p>
              <p>
                We discuss the common miss-conceptions about nutrition and help
                you not fall into the habit of convenience food at the cost of
                health (and quite often your budget too).
              </p>
              <p>
                The health forum classes alternate between weeks and they
                operate both in off-peak and peak hours so that everyone can
                benefit.
