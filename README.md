# Design

## Design Choices
# Look & feel 
As the brand name indicates, this gym’s main focus is an inviting place for all to improve their health and vitality, and the financial focus for the company is to increase off-peak memberships between the hours of 9:30 - 15:30 with a heavy focus on Parent’s of school age children.  So the branding must be positive, nurturing and healthy but with a serious gym-going undertone to make it accessible for all.
